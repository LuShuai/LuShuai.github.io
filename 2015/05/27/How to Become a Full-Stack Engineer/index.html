        <p>==============================</p>
<h2 id="Imagine_building_a_simple_app_like_this">Imagine building a simple app like this</h2><p>A weather forecast app, with clean and simple interface, the weather information is so easy to access. It could not only forecast the weather of the following 10 days, but also get the weather history of some given locations. It can also be used as a reminder on web, iOS, as well as Android devices.</p>
<p>Why? Because you like traveling, but failed to find an app that could provide you the weather information of a specific city in a specific day next month; Because you hate to check the weather information everyday. You would like to be friendly reminded when the temperature becomes higher than 30 degrees Celsius or the temperature difference is larger than +-7 degrees; Because you want to be a ‘Full Stack Engineer’. You must restlessly train yourself, on every single ‘stack’.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h2 id="Web_Version">Web Version</h2><p>You decided to store users data with MySql, and use NoSql for weather data, to build a cache with Redis, caching some of the often requested data. You built the backend with Python, with very simple functionalities, user registration and login, fetching weather data of a specific city, fetching history data of a city, it shouldn’t take too long.</p>
<p>After the backend is all set, then you need to work on the web side. You are so clear how important a good UI design is for a good app. And you are also clear that a UI is not simple in terms of beauty, but in terms of improving the readability of data and usability of the app. Fortunately you know it. You started to work on hundreds of good UI designs you collected before, you grabbed the classic book <the design="" of="" everyday="" things=""> —- Norman. Finally you finalized the first version of your UI, simple but straightforward, no redundant design. Every element is well organized. You believe the app will bring its users a good mood even in bad weather.</the></p>
<p>Let’s then start to implement it. Wait, don’t forget Icon and  Logo. What if you never used PS, AI nor Sketch? Just learn them. You have friends in different areas, there happened to be a design girl. She spent a whole afternoon teaching you the basic usage of Sketch, and gave you some advices about your UI design. You thanked her, and then immediately adjusted your UI according to her advices. You drew you design with Ps this time as well as Icons and  a Logo.</p>
<p>In the next week, you learned  HTML,CSS and Javascript, perfectly got the web side done.</p>
<h2 id="First_release">First release</h2><p>You sent a moment about your app, wanted to invite some friend for a Beta test. They asked you what app is it. ‘A weather app’ you simply answered. But you then noticed that, they were not interested. You felt you need something more or even a story to describe what this app is about. This is the answer to their question, as well as an important skill of becoming a ‘full stack engineer’.</p>
<p>You went to home pages of websites you like, trying to be enlightened by their designs. You red the classic book <on writing="" well=""> . And you found that, a good advertisement, a good design and a piece of good code are the same thing. The point of them are consistent: communication, conveying your ideas to others in a easy way. Your story needs to be attractive, and you need to be able to tell others what your app does within 1 minute, and make sure your parents can get the idea without being confused.</on></p>
<p>After everything is done, you release it. It was getting positive feedbacks, and the user amount is also growing. Some users told you they hope to have an iOS version. Then you decided to start to work on your iOS version.</p>
<h2 id="iOS_Version_and_Backend_Optimization">iOS Version and Backend Optimization</h2><p>You spent less than a week learning the basic grammar and tools and started the development. You knew ‘Learn by Doing’ is the best way. Since you already got the design background, you set up the UI and Icons pretty fast, a very short moment later, the iOS version is released. Since the releasing of iOS version brought more and more users, the load of the backend was getting heavier and heavier, you knew it is time now, to optimize the backend.</p>
<p>You ordered 2 more instances on AWS, and wrote a script to automize the deployment.。</p>
<p>You switched to uWSGi protocol, used it as the Application Server.</p>
<p>You used  Nginx for concurrency and load balancing …</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>……</p>
<h2 id="Setting_up_a_company">Setting up a company</h2><p>As the number of users kept growing, you could get 10-20 emails from users everyday. You felt thankful for their time, you believed they are your most important users and the potential users who are going to pay for the app. If you treated them as your gods, they would treat you as their god. So you reply to every single of these emails within 2 hours unless you were sleeping.</p>
<p>You paid a lot for doing this, but you also gained a lot by doing this. They were surprised that you could response so fast. They decided to give your ★★★★★ reviews in the app store, share your app in social networks. They even started to donate you voluntarily. </p>
<p>You smelled opportunity in the fast grow user number. You then started to think about how to make money. Advertisement is the last choice, you believed even with the best targeting technology, advertisement ruins the user experience. You designed 2 payment plans, tried to make the final decision by A/B testing. You sent out 200 emails to invite users to try your paid version. You worked so hard and carefully about the email content, added your name with CEO &amp; Founder in the end. After analysing user behaviours under these 2 plans, you finally picked plan B.</p>
<p>You thought then, it is time to set up a company. To save time, you spent 2000 to find a incubator and they registered a company for you. The name of the company gave you a headache. You didn’t want to simply use the app name as the company name, because you knew you will build more good apps under the name of this company. You wanted a simple name which is easy to remember and could express the culture of your company.</p>
<p>Then you finished the registration, contacted the bank side on your own. You also contacted some media guys, inviting them to try your product. You redesigned the homepage of your product, and  set up a blog for it. You registered public accounts in every social network, for your customer service and product publicity… These stuffs compressed you coding time. You used to measure your production of a day by code commits, thus making you think you are doing nothing in recently.</p>
<p>The development was far more beyond your expectation. The app, from a side project, became your entire life. You hung out with your girl friend once a month, and she was complaining a lot. You had not gone to a bar with your friends for 1 month, and had not gone to gym for 2 months… You realised that, YOU CAN NOT DO THIS ALONE, you need someone to help, to keep this going on.</p>
<p>But didn’t you want to be a  Full Stack Engineer? Are you a full stack engineer now?</p>
<h2 id="Full_Stack_Engineer">Full Stack Engineer</h2><p>Design，backend, frontend，mobile side, service engineering, photo shop, publication… Now I can do them all, am I a Full Stack Engineer?</p>
<p>No, this is just the first step of becoming a  Full Stack Engineer. So far, you know a little bit on every  stack, but you are still far from senior or expert, it requires a lot of time and effort to become good on every stack. But time and effort are both limited, and this is a lonely road that you can communicate to no one else. Do I have to allocate some of the works to someone else? By doing this, am I still a Full Stack Engineer?</p>
<p>The answer is NO.</p>
<p>What is Engineer？’Engineers are versatile minds who create links between science, technology, and society’.</p>
<p>The essential of a engineer is to design and develop products that could be used by public.</p>
<p>A real Full Stack Engineer can always find out problems and requirements in real life. And he can also come up with a solution, and build the prototype. To achieve this, he is always willing to learn technologies of every aspects, and not pursuing to achieve this on his own. If someone could do better in an aspect, he will always try to invite him to join the team.</p>
<p>Finally he’s not an  Engineer any more. He no longer designs UI nor the code … His job is no longer  design and building an app or product, because he now has something more important to do  - design and building a team or a company which builds great products.</p>
<p>Now, we have a new name for these guys - entrepreneurs. Although other people already forgot they were engineerings, but they are engineers, inside. When they need to start from scratch again, they will start from product design without any hesitation. Nikola Tesla，Ferdinand Porsche，Henry Ford，Jack Dorsey，Mark zuckerberg，Elon Musk … those who changed the world, most of them have Engineer background, and good at designing and building things. They learn, not to become experts of an area, but to get information they need to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>That is the definition of Full Stack Engineer in my mind.</p>
